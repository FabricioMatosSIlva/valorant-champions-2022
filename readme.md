### **Project Objective**

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the statistical data from the Valorant Champions 2022 tournament in Istanbul, using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly to create visualizations that help understand player and team performance, highlighting the historic victory of the Brazilian team LOUD.

### **Dataset Description**

The dataset includes information on 40 players who participated in the tournament. The main columns include:

* **Player:** Player name
* **Team:** Team name
* **Nationality:** Player nationality
* **Kill/Death (K/D):** Kill-to-death ratio
* **KAST:** Participation in won rounds (%)
* **Prize:** Prize money
* **Role:** Player role in the team (e.g., Initiator, Duelist)
* **Rounds Played/Win/Lose:** Round statistics
* **Rank:** Final team placement

---

### **Main Steps of the Project**

#### **1. Data Cleaning and Preparation**

* Converting string-based columns to numeric types (e.g., Prize and KAST)
* Adjusting Rank values to integers
* Checking and handling inconsistencies in the dataset

#### **2. Exploratory Analysis**

* Histograms and scatter plots to understand distribution by roles and performance (K/D and KAST)
* Performance comparisons between players such as pANcada (LOUD) and MaKo (DRX), including detailed polar charts
* Correlation analysis between variables (e.g., Prize, K/D, Rounds Win)

#### **3. Highlight Visualizations**

* Bar charts of the top 10 players across metrics such as Kills, K/D, KAST, and HS%
* Team comparisons, emphasizing LOUD’s superior performance over others
* Analysis of the relationship between Prize, KAST, and K/D, showing how the champions had balanced statistics

---

### **Key Insights**

* LOUD had the most consistent lineup, with players performing at very similar levels
* Players like Less and pANcada stood out in eliminations and overall impact, demonstrating the team’s balance and collective strength
* Although individual performance matters, the tournament reinforced the importance of teamwork in games like Valorant

### **Tools Used**

* **Python:** For data manipulation and analysis
* **Seaborn and Matplotlib:** For plotting and understanding data distributions
* **Plotly:** For interactive visualizations such as polar and scatter plots
* **Kaggle:** Platform for exploring the dataset and sharing the project

---

### **Conclusion**

This project illustrates how LOUD’s success at Valorant Champions 2022 resulted from a combination of consistent player performance, teamwork, and strong individual impact. The statistical and visual analysis helps explain the factors that led Brazil to the top of the competitive Valorant scene.
